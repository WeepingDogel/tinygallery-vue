# TinyGallery Vue Edition FrontEnd

![](/src/assets/TinyGallery_Logo.png)

Welcome to TinyGallery Vue Edition FrontEnd - an open-source project that provides a simple and free gallery service for drawing lovers. The project is divided into two parts: frontend and backend.

The frontend is built using Vue.js, Vite, TypeScript, CSS3, and Yarn. It features a simple and clean user interface, fast and responsive design, and is easy to use and navigate.

The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. The database used is SQLite, a lightweight disk-based database engine that doesn't require a separate server process. You can find the source code for the backend at [TinyGallery BackEnd](https://github.com/WeepingDogel/tinygallery-backend).
